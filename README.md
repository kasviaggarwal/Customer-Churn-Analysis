**Objective:**

The goal is to analyze key metrics and demographic data to understand why customers are leaving and identify opportunities to improve customer retention.

**Churn Rate Analysis:**

The churn rate, indicating the percentage of customers who stopped using the service during a certain time period, is a significant factor. Analyzing this rate helps us understand the reasons behind customer attrition and take appropriate actions to reduce it.

**Demographic Analysis:**

1. **Gender Distribution:**
   - Displays the count of customers based on gender, categorized as male and female.

2. **Tenure:**
   - Customer tenure ranges from 1 to 72 months, indicating both new and long-standing customers.

3. **Internet Service:**
   - Fiber optic is the most popular internet service among customers, followed by DSL.

4. **Online Security & Tech Support:**
   - Customers subscribing to online security and tech support services exhibit a lower churn rate, valuing security and assistance.

5. **Contract Type:**
   - Customers with longer contract durations (e.g., one year or two years) are less likely to churn compared to those on a month-to-month contract.

**Billing & Payment Analysis:**

1. **Paperless Billing:**
   - Customers opting for paperless billing may have different behavior compared to those receiving paper bills.

2. **Payment Method:**
   - The choice of payment method (e.g., electronic check, credit card, bank transfer) might influence customer loyalty and churn rate.

3. **Monthly Charges:**
